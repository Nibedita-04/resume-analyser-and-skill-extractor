Resume Skill Extractor

An AI-powered resume parsing system that extracts structured skill data using Large Language Models (LLMs), Pydantic-based schema enforcement, and output parsing. The project supports both batch resume processing and an interactive Streamlit web interface.

Project Overview

This tool automates the extraction of skills and relevant resume fields while ensuring clean, structured, and validated outputs. It is designed as a scalable foundation for advanced resume analytics, matching, and recruitment intelligence systems.

The extraction pipeline ensures that only meaningful and non-empty fields are returned, improving readability and downstream usability.

System Workflow
Batch Mode (main.py)

Loads resumes from a folder in batches (currently limited to 5 resumes per run)

Sends resume text to an LLM using a structured prompt through a LangChain pipeline

Uses a Pydantic schema to define and enforce expected extraction fields

Parses and validates model outputs with an output parser

Displays structured extraction results in the terminal

Filters out empty fields to maintain clean outputs

Streamlit Web Application

Allows users to upload a resume via a browser interface

Processes resumes using the same extraction pipeline

Displays extracted skills and structured fields instantly

Automatically removes empty or irrelevant fields from results

Key Features

LLM-driven resume skill extraction

Pydantic-based schema validation for structured outputs

Tech Stack

Python

LangChain

Pydantic

Streamlit

Large Language Model API (OpenAI/Groq/Compatible APIs)

Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-skill-extractor.git
cd resume-skill-extractor
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run Batch Processing
python main.py


Ensure resumes are placed inside the configured input folder.

Run Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py


Upload a resume via the UI to extract skills interactively.

Output Format

Results are returned as structured JSON-like objects containing only non-empty extracted fields.

Example:

{
  "technical_skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning"],
  "tools": ["Git", "Docker"],
  "soft_skills": ["Communication", "Problem Solving"]
}

Future Roadmap

Database integration for storing parsed resumes

Resume-to-job matching and ranking algorithms

Skill gap analysis and candidate profiling

Scalable multi-user API service

Analytics dashboard for recruiters and HR teams

Purpose

This project serves as a base pipeline for building intelligent hiring, talent screening, and resume intelligence platforms.
